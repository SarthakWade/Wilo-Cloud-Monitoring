# Hardware Connection Issue - MPU6050 Sensor

## Current Status

The MPU6050 sensor is not being detected by the Raspberry Pi. Multiple diagnostic tests confirm this is a hardware connectivity issue:

1. **I2C Bus Scan**: No devices detected on I2C bus 1
2. **Direct I2C Communication**: Connection timeout error
3. **MPU6050 Library Test**: Connection timeout error

## Root Cause Analysis

The error `[Errno 110] Connection timed out` indicates that the Raspberry Pi is attempting to communicate with the sensor but not receiving a response. This typically means:

1. **Physical Connection Issues**:
   - Loose or incorrect wiring
   - Broken wires or connectors
   - Sensor not properly powered

2. **Hardware Problems**:
   - Damaged or defective MPU6050 sensor
   - Incorrect sensor model (not a genuine MPU6050)
   - Sensor requiring different voltage levels

## Required Hardware Connections

Ensure the following connections between MPU6050 and Raspberry Pi:

```
MPU6050 Pin  →  Raspberry Pi Pin
VCC (VDD)    →  3.3V (Pin 1)
GND          →  Ground (Pin 6)
SCL          →  GPIO 3 (Pin 5)
SDA          →  GPIO 2 (Pin 3)
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Physical Connections**:
   - Disconnect and reconnect all wires
   - Verify correct pin assignments
   - Ensure no short circuits between adjacent pins
   - Confirm MPU6050 is receiving 3.3V power

2. **Test with Multimeter**:
   - Check continuity between connected pins
   - Verify 3.3V is reaching the sensor
   - Check resistance between SDA/SCL and ground (should not be 0Ω)

3. **Try Different Hardware**:
   - Test with a different MPU6050 sensor
   - Try a different Raspberry Pi if available
   - Test the same sensor with an Arduino (if available)

## Temporary Testing Solution

For development and testing purposes without hardware, use the temporary testing version:

```bash
cd /home/willo/Desktop/Wilo-Cloud-Monitoring/backend
python sensor_service_testing.py
```

This version includes simulation logic and will work without a physical sensor. **DO NOT use this for production.**

## Production Requirements

For production deployment, a working MPU6050 sensor connection is mandatory. The production backend (`sensor_service.py`) will raise exceptions and halt operation if the sensor is not available.

## Next Steps

1. **Hardware Troubleshooting**:
   - Double-check all wiring connections
   - Verify power supply to the sensor
   - Try a different MPU6050 sensor

2. **Refer to Detailed Troubleshooting Guide**:
   See [SENSOR_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](file:///home/willo/Desktop/Wilo-Cloud-Monitoring/SENSOR_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting steps.

3. **Contact Hardware Support**:
   If all troubleshooting steps fail, contact the sensor manufacturer or hardware supplier.

## Important Notes

- The backend system has been correctly modified to work only with real sensor data
- Simulation logic has been removed from production code
- The temporary testing version is clearly marked and should only be used for development
- Once hardware issues are resolved, the production backend will work correctly
